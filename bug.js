This bug occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses a lot of asynchronous operations.  The app might crash or become unresponsive, especially when there are many network requests or long-running tasks happening concurrently. This is likely due to limitations in the Expo Go environment's ability to handle heavy asynchronous workloads effectively. The issue is less apparent when running the app in a standalone build because the standalone build has access to native resources more directly.
